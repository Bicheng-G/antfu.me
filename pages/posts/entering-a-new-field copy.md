When you first start to study a field, it seems like you have to memorize a zillion things.

You don’t. What you need is to identify the core principles – generally three to twelve of them – that govern the field.

The million things you thought you had to memorize are simply various combinations of the core principles.

——A fantastic quote from John Reed, in his book ‘Succeeding’.

&nbsp;

当你头一次开始研究一个领域的时候，似乎不得不把万千头绪都记在脑子里。

其实大可不必，你需要做的只是辨别哪个领域同新的核心法则，一般只有3到12条。

你觉得自己必须要牢记的东西不过是这些核心法则的多种排列组合。

——John Reed

例如：

减肥的核心法则 -> 管住嘴，迈开腿
