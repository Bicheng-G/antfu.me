Today I had a great discussion with my colleague Jason, and his words - I have strong desire to note them down.

Main topics:

- The top 3 sports kids should be learning
- I then shared how my kid wants to play badminton with us, but he wasn’t capable to use the brackets yet.
- How kids gain ability to focus those activities
- My boss’s opinion - phonics
