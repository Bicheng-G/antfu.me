Phenomeal Clarity of vision people gain at the end of thier lives (same top 5 regrets people expressed in the last 12 weeks of life) —— Bronnie Ware, Australian Nurse

1. I wish I'd had the <span font-bold font-mono text-blue>Courage</span> to live a life true to myself, not life other's expected for me.

2. I wish I hadn't worked so hard. (Every male patient) Felt they missed their children's youth & partner's companionship.

3. I wish I'd had the <span font-bold font-mono text-blue>Courage</span> to express my feelings.

4. I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.

5. I wish that I had let myself be <span font-bold font-mono text-lime>Happier</span>. Realized happiness was a choice.

Reminder.
