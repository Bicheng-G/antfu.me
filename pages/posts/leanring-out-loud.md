_"普信(pu xin)"_ is a internet slang in China, which translates to "ordinary yet confident." This term was initially conceived with a derogatory nuance, suggesting "What is there to be confident about when you are so ordinary?"

# Learn In Public

However, after becoming acquainted with the idea of "learn in public," I began to view this term in a new light. Even if you're ordinary, you can still exude confidence as long as you keep moving. You don't need to have secured a Gold Medal or made the Dean's list to be worthy of posting on LinkedIn, nor do you need to be a tech guru to answer questions on StackOverflow. Pick up from where they left, what sets you apart is your beginner's mindset. And that is crucial.

# Show Your Work

This view is also supported in Austin Kleon's "Show Your Work," where he posits that you don't need to be a genius or an expert to share knowledge; beginners can also help other beginners. Make it a habit to share something useful daily; the measure of whether the content is useful is if it can assist others. A practical tip to quickly start adopting this practice: summarize your day's work each day and find content that can be shared. It could be an inspiration or a spark, methodologies and progress, outcomes and insights, or management and collaboration.

# Conclusion

Teach others what you know. What's important is continually summarizing, categorizing, contemplating, and expressing what you've learned. What you can articulate is truly what you understand and have mastered.
